          Our mission is to give inspectors the freedom to choose how they work. Without our product, 
          inspectors are limited to paperwork forms. In the digital age, many of us are comfortable 
          working on our computers and mobile devices. Access to online forms can make it easier for 
          inspectors to do their job. In summary, our product can have significant impact on New York 
          Cities inspector workforce.
